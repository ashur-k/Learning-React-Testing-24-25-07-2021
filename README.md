### About This Repo:
##### I have clone this repo while doing my Udemy course react developer zero to mastery and in this part I was learning how to write test for react app


### Purpose This Repo
1. To write test codes for redux
2. To write test code for react components


# My Experience:
##### It was good course, I have written all codes while following along. Now I know about react testing, and have confidence I can write my tests. I really enjoyed following along, and was goggling and doing extra research where it was necessary. I have learnt about different testing frameworks available and how they are different from each other. I learnt how you can write tests in plain scripts file. I learnt about what are unit, integration and automation testing. LEarnt about setting up jest, asynchronous function testing, API testing. Overall it was fun doing this 3 hours 32 minutes section on testing.
